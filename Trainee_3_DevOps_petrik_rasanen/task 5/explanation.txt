Task 5
All is in pod folder.
First, I created config.yaml, and marked the wanted variables there (default config from interent)
Kubectl threw error about the boolean on debug. When I changed it to be string, it worked. 
    I don't know why this is, I learned about kubernetes literaly yesterday.
Then I created the config for Kubectl.
Then I created pod.yaml for the busybox pod, default config  lifted from internet.
For Envs, pulled the wanted variables from config and named them properly.
Then changed the startup command to echo env and debug variables to the pod logs. Lastly added command to sleep 3600s.
