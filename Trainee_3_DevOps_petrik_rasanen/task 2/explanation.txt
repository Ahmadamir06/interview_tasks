task 2
First pulled wordpress chart, to be able to make changes locally and save them, as well as installed bitnami repositoru
Made following changes to the main values.yaml:
changed in image:
wordpressUsername to admin
wordpressPassword to admin_password
wordpressEmail to admin@example.com

For database:
Changed mariadb password to db_password in mariadb: auth: password
Checked that persistence was true in mariadb config. 

With this changes, I believe that it should reflect the requirements. 
However, this is my first time using helm, so I'm not certain, if I should have changed some settings to perhaps enable mariadb.
I believe not, but I'm not certain.
Started application with helm install bitnami/wordpress --values wordpress/values.yaml
I have not tested this, as I don't know how to deploy a local helm chart. 
I tried with command helm install wordpress --values /path/values.yaml, but got error about non-absolute URLs.
This is due to me never having done anything with helm before
