First, check that the file exists.
Then grep for Info, warnings and errors separately, and count the results with wc -l to get only the lines (messed around a bit with read line, but grep is much easier)
This so that if we have [INFO] [INFO] something, we don't count it twice.
Echo results to terminal for user.
Grep errors again and pipe them to errors_only.log for later analysis.

If the file is not found, notify the user and don't try to grep the file.

For this to be more efficient, maybe we could grep errors into the file and count them at the same time.
However, i don't know how to do this, or if it's possible
